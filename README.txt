The only WordPress plugin not afraid to give you dirty looks.

== Description ==

The purpose of this plugin is to shame content editors into updating page content that has not been touched in a long time, while simultaneously providing an overview of the oldest pages on a site. Also: gifs.

The plugin adds an **Out of Date Pages** subpage under the Pages menu, which breaks all the pages on the site down by last modified date, grouped by years since it's been modified. Each page listed has a link to edit the page. All images on the Out of Date Pages subpage are sourced from [reactiongifs.com](http://reactiongifs.com).

== Installation ==

1. Extract the zip file and upload to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the Plugins menu in the WordPress dashboard.
3. Profit!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I'm a translator. I don't understand some of these captions. =

I'm well aware that there are some jokes/captions that may get lost in translation. Translators should feel free to make the captions their own in a way that makes the most sense in their language. There should not be any requirement (or assumption of a requirement) that the captions are "set in stone" and can't be different than their source. All other translatable strings should be handled normally.

= Can I submit reactions/captions? =

Sure. Submit a ticket [here](https://github.com/jazzsequence/Update-Shaming/issues/new).
